## üî® Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following tools installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - Required for the frontend development.
- [Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) - Needed to run the Spring Boot application.
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) - The database system used for persistent storage.
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) - For managing Spring Boot dependencies.

### Frontend Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project-name.git
    cd your-project-name/frontend
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Run the development server**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
   The application will be served at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

### Backend Setup

1. **Navigate to the backend directory**:
    ```bash
    cd your-project-name/backend
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    mvn install
    ```

3. **Configure MongoDB**:
    - Ensure MongoDB is running locally or update the `application.properties` file with your MongoDB connection string.
   

4. **Start the Spring Boot application**:
